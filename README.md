# EEE4120F--YODA: Image Edge Detection Processing (IEDP)

Welcome to the repository for our final-year digital systems project, developed for the EEE4120F course. This project is focused on hardware-accelerated image processing using Verilog HDL and C, and includes implementations of Median Filtering and Sobel Edge Detection.
